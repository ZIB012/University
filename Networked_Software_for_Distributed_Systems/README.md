# Networked Software for Distributed Systems
The course presents key technologies for the design and implementation of large scale network applications and complex distributed systems, 
including scenarios of high-performance computing, big-data analytics, event-driven architectures, Internet of Things, edge computing, and mobile robotics. 
The course favors a practical approach: the explanation of concepts and abstractions is tightly linked to their practical application, 
using the the most appropriate technology at hand for the considered scenario.
